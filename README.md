# dnd_react
_Written for fun and learning by @spencermendoza and @nilz3ro_.
This app allows users to input their Dungeons and Dragons party plus any monsters during an encounter and track the initiative order, armor class, damage, and hit points. This makes it easier for the Dungeon Master and players to keep track of how each encounter goes.

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
